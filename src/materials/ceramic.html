          <p>
            Oxide ceramics are inorganic compounds of metallic (e.g., Al, Zr,
            Ti, Mg) or metalloid (Si) elements with oxygen. Oxides can be
            combined with nitrogen or carbon to form more complex oxynitride or
            oxycarbide ceramics. Oxide ceramics have high melting points.

            Silicate Ceramic
          </button>

          <p>
            Silicate Ceramics were the first technical ceramics developed to
            support early electrical technologies, including Magnesium Silicates
            (Steatite and Cordierite) and Mullite. Because of the large volumes
            of product involved, traditional ceramics tend to be manufactured
            from naturally occurring raw materials

            Carbide Ceramic
          </button>
          <p>
            Carbide ceramics are extremely resistant to high temperatures,
            abrasion, and corrosion. They have a high thermal and variable
            electrical conductivity and are mainly used in mechanical
            engineering, chemical, and power engineering, microelectronics as
            well as space engineering.

            Nitride Ceramic
          </button>
          <p>
            Nitride ceramics have experienced tremendous development in the last
            decades. Whereas Si3N4 and SiAlON-based ceramics were at forefront
            of fundamental research related to nitride ceramics, the field has
            expanded significantly, including more and more nitride
            compositions.

            Glass Ceramic
          </button>
          <p>
            Glass Ceramic materials have the same chemical compositions as
            glasses but differ from them in that they are typically 95-98%
            crystalline by volume, with only a small percentage vitreous. The
            crystals themselves are generally very small, less than 1µm, and
            most often very uniform in size.
